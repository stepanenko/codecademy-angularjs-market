## AngularJS Market App
### from [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-angularjs)

This is our typical workflow when making an AngularJS app:

- ``ng-app`` is used to define the application scope
- ``ng-controller`` is used to define the controller scope
- Adding data to controller will display it in the view
- A module contains the different components of an AngularJS app
- A controller manages the app’s data
- The view automatically changes and displays the updated data
- The page doesn’t need to reload at any point

We’ve used a few directives in this app:
- ng-app
- ng-controller
- ng-repeat
- ng-src
- ng-click

Directives bind behavior to HTML elements. When the app runs,
AngularJS walks through each HTML element looking for directives.
When it finds one, AngularJS triggers that behavior
(like attaching a scope or looping through an array).
